The School Event Manager bot automates many processes associated with planning and conducting school events. It provides the following features:

1. Adding events: The administrator can add a new event, specify its name, start and end date, and a short description.
    
2. Setting task deadlines: For each activity, you can specify a list of tasks that need to be completed and set deadlines for them.
    
3. Assigning tasks to users: Event participants can be assigned specific tasks that they are responsible for completing.
    
4. Report generation: the bot provides the ability to generate reports on the progress of tasks, which can be used to monitor the process and adjust employee salaries.
    
5. Notify the administrator: if the event is approaching its deadline or needs to be cancelled, the bot notifies the administrator.
    
6. Optimization of the management process: thanks to the use of a bot, the event management process becomes more efficient and transparent for all participants.
